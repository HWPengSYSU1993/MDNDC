# MDNDC
We propose Scatter Loss objective function which can bridge the modality gap while preserving the identity information. Secondly, we design a Multiple Deep Networks structure for feature extraction, and propose a joint decision strategy called Diversity Combination to adaptively adjust weights of each deep network.

The inception-resnet-v1 network structure can be found here (https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).
